I am reverting to my original `dashboard.js` architecture (separate loaders for Facebook, Google, Instagram), but I need to fix a critical data loss issue where valid data is not showing up.

### THE PROBLEM
Currently, the dashboard queries filter by the Ad's "Launch Date" (e.g., `start_date_string` or `first_show`).
**The Issue:** My scraper runs **Today**, but it finds ads that launched **2 months ago**.
- The Dashboard filters for "Today".
- The Ad's launch date is "Nov 2025".
- **Result:** The data is hidden (Missing Data).

### THE TASK
Refactor the three loader functions (`loadFacebookAds`, `loadGoogleAds`, `loadInstagramPosts`) to filter by the **Scrape Date** (`snapshot_date`) so that all data captured today appears, regardless of when the ad launched.

**1. Update `loadFacebookAds`:**
- **Filter Column:** Change `.gte('start_date_string', ...)` to `.gte('snapshot_date', ...)` (and `.lte`).
- **Ordering:** Order by `snapshot_date` descending.
- **Missing Data Fix:** If `snapshot_date` is missing for some rows, include them or fallback to `created_at`.

**2. Update `loadGoogleAds`:**
- **Filter Column:** Change `.gte('first_show', ...)` to `.gte('snapshot_date', ...)` (and `.lte`).
- **Ordering:** Order by `snapshot_date` descending.

**3. Update `loadInstagramPosts`:**
- Verify which column represents the "Ingestion Time" (likely `created_at` or `snapshot_date`) and filter by that.

**4. Data Robustness (Fixing "Partial" Breaks):**
- **Null Checks:** Ensure that if `ad_image_url` or `page_name` is null, the code does NOT crash or hide the row. Provide default empty strings or placeholders.
- **Console Logs:** You MUST add `console.log` inside each loader showing:
  `console.log('[Facebook] Filter range:', filters.dateFrom, 'to', filters.dateTo);`
  `console.log('[Facebook] Rows found:', data?.length);`
  This allows me to debug exactly why data might still be missing.

**Constraints:**
- Do NOT change the `updateTableUI` function or HTML.
- Keep the `!inner` join on `companies` to maintain the company filter.
- Keep the Promise.all pattern.

Please generate the corrected code for the loader functions.
