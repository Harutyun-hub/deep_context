Master Prompt for Replit AI
Context: The "War Room" Initiative We are building a new, advanced analytics interface called "The War Room" for our existing Competitive Intelligence SaaS ("Nimbus AI").

Current State:

We have a functional dashboard (dashboard.html) connected to Supabase. Do not touch or break existing files.

We have a new SQL View in Supabase called intelligence_scores that aggregates complex metrics (Aggression Score, Threat Level, etc.).

Goal: We are creating a new standalone page (war_room.html) that acts as a "Tactical Command Center" for marketing directors.

The Product Philosophy: "Active Defense" The current dashboard is passive (just tables). The War Room is active. It answers the question "Am I safe?" in 5 seconds. It uses military/tactical aesthetics to create urgency.

The Design Language: "Neon Glass"

Base Style: Glassmorphism (keep the transparency/blur).

The Shift: Switch from "Light/Airy" to "Dark/Cyberpunk".

Background: Deep Slate/Charcoal (#0F172A).

Accents: High-contrast Neon.

Threat/Enemy: Glowing Crimson Red (#EF4444).

Safe/Ally: Glowing Electric Blue (#3B82F6) or Emerald Green (#10B981).

Vibe: Think Bloomberg Terminal meets Call of Duty HUD.

Fonts: Keep Inter for headers, but strictly use JetBrains Mono or Monospace for data points/numbers.

Implementation Rules:

New Files Only: Create war_room.html, war_room.css, and war_room.js.

Supabase: Use the existing SupabaseManager.js client but fetch data from our new intelligence_scores view.

Step-by-Step: We will build this section by section. Do not hallucinate future features yet.

Task 1: The Command Deck (Home View)
Objective: Build the skeleton of the War Room and the "Hero Section" (The Command Deck).

Requirements:

Structure: Create the war_room.html with a dark, immersive background.

The "DEFCON" Module:

Fetch the threat_level ('CRITICAL', 'ELEVATED', 'SECURE') from the intelligence_scores view.

Visual: A massive, central Glass card.

Logic:

If CRITICAL: The glass border should pulse Red. Text: "HIGH THREAT DETECTED".

If SECURE: The glass border glows Green. Text: "SYSTEM SECURE".

The "Aggression" Gauge:

Fetch the aggression_score (0-100).

Display it as a large number or semi-circle chart next to the Threat Level.

The Ticker Tape:

A fixed footer bar scrolling horizontally (like a stock market ticker).

Display: "Live Competitor Activity..." (Mock the content for now, just get the animation right).

Technical Note:

Query the intelligence_scores view using supabase.from('intelligence_scores').select('*').

Focus heavily on the CSS effects (backdrop-filter, box-shadows) to nail the "Neon Glass" look immediately.

Let's build the Command Deck.
