You are absolutely right. The Rich Context is the most valuable piece of intelligence we generated, so it must be front-and-center when the user investigates a topic.

Here is the updated, specific instruction set for your AI Agent. I have added a dedicated section emphasizing that the Click Interaction is the primary way this data is revealed.

Prompt for AI Agent (Updated):

"I need you to refactor my full stack application (Backend & Frontend) to support a new 'Enterprise Graph Schema' in Neo4j. Currently, the dashboard is filtering out most of my data and failing to show the new intelligence we generated.

Here is the exact logic for what needs to change:

PART 1: Backend Logic (server.js)
Fix the 'Missing Brands' Bug (Priority):

Remove any aggressive filters like WHERE weight > 2.

Use OPTIONAL MATCH logic. I need to see ALL 13 Brands returned in the JSON, even if they have zero ads or connections. Do not hide 'small' nodes.

Extract the 'Rich Context' (The Intelligence):

In the database, the strategy explanation is stored on the relationship: (:Ad)-[:COVERS_TOPIC {context: '...'}]->(:Topic).

You must extract this context string.

Aggregation: Since a Topic might be connected to multiple Ads, collect these contexts into a list (or pick the most distinct one) and bundle it inside the Topic Node's data payload.

Data Type Safety:

Convert Neo4j datetime() objects to Strings (toString(a.date)) before sending to the frontend to prevent crashes.

Extract the platform string from the [:PUBLISHED] relationship to use for link coloring.

PART 2: Frontend Logic (GraphDashboard.jsx)
The 'Click' Interaction (Critical):

Current Behavior: Clicking a dot just shows the name.

Required Behavior: When a user clicks a Topic Node (the purple dots), the UI must display the Rich Context string we fetched from the backend.

Implementation:

Open a Side Panel or detailed view upon click.

Display the context text prominently (e.g., 'Subsidized 2% annual rate for students...') as the description of the topic.

Below the context, list the supporting 'Evidence' (ad snippets and dates) so the user understands why that context exists.

Visual Logic:

Dynamic Links: Color the lines between Brand and Topic based on the platform (Pink for Instagram, Blue for Facebook, etc.).

Node Visibility: Ensure unconnected Brand nodes are visible (do not filter them out).

Summary: The goal is to ensure that when I click a Topic node in the dashboard, I don't just see 'Student Loans'. I must see the full sentence explaining the strategy ('Student Loans with 2% subsidized rate...'). Sync the backend query and frontend click-handler to make this happen."
